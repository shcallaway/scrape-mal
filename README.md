# Scrape MAL

:innocent:

## Usage

Create a virtual environment with `make dev`. Activate the virtual environment with `source venv/bin/activate`. This will modify your $PATH so that Python dependencies are resolved from the `venv/lib` directory, instead of from your global lib. You can deactivate it at any time by running `deactivate`.

Run `python3 scrape_mal.py`.
